Extended functionalities of UIColor

Apple has wonderfully implemented all the necessary functionalities in its SDK. Even though as a developer we can ever find some more shortcuts and some extra functionality for our day-to-day programming life.


which are...

1. Creating UIColor object from RGB values (0 - 255) instead of percentage. 
2. UIColor object from hex color string. E.g.  @"#F0F8FF" or @"F0F8FF"
3. Getting RGB values and alpha from UIColor

and methods to create 127 different colors which are defined by X11 and W3C. E.g. crimsonColor.

UIColor *color = [UIColor crimsonColor];

and many more.
